# InMoov Humanoid Hand & Forearm — Explanation

## 1. Introduction
The InMoov hand and forearm is an open-source, 3D-printed robotic limb designed by Gaël Langevin.  
It is widely used in robotics research, education, and prototyping because all parts, instructions, and codes are free and customizable.

This design uses **tendon-driven mechanics**, **servo motors**, and **modular 3D-printed components** to replicate the basic movement of a human hand and wrist.

## 2. Major Components

### 2.1 3D-Printed Parts
The assembly consists of several printed parts including:
- Five fingers (thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky)
- Wrist components (rotational and tilt)
- Forearm shells
- Gear mechanisms
- Servo brackets and cable guides
- Covers and structural supports

Each part is printed separately and then assembled using screws, glue, and bolts.

## 3. Working Principle

### 3.1 Tendon-Driven Mechanism
The fingers of the InMoov hand move using **nylon fishing lines** that act like tendons.  
When a servo rotates, it **pulls the tendon**, causing the finger to bend.  
When the servo releases, the finger returns to its open position, assisted by:
- Elastic tension  
- Mechanical design of joints

### 3.2 Servo Motors
Each finger has one or more servos for actuation.  
Servos are placed inside the forearm and connected to the tendons.

Servo functions:
- Pull tendons to close the fingers
- Release tendons to open fingers
- Rotate and tilt the wrist using gear-driven servos

## 4. Electronics and Control

### 4.1 Microcontroller
The system typically uses:
- Arduino Mega  
- Arduino Uno (for smaller setups)

### 4.2 Power Supply
A dedicated 5V–6V external supply is recommended due to high servo current draw.

### 4.3 Programming
Servos are controlled through PWM signals generated by the microcontroller.

A basic Arduino program includes:
- Attaching servos to pins  
- Setting initial (zero) positions  
- Moving servos to given angles  
- Creating finger sequences like open/close motions

## 5. Assembly Overview

### 5.1 Printing
Parts must be printed with:
- 20–30% infill
- Good dimensional accuracy
- Minimal warping (calibrator is provided for accuracy)

### 5.2 Mechanical Assembly
The steps include:
1. Printing all finger and wrist parts  
2. Aligning and gluing/screwing joints  
3. Installing servos  
4. Routing tendons through Teflon tubes  
5. Adjusting tension using tensioners  
6. Installing wrist rotation and gear system  

### 5.3 Calibration
- Each servo is set to **90° neutral position** before attaching tendons  
- Tendon tightness is adjusted so that fingers stay straight at neutral  
- Movements are tested with small angle increments

## 6. Applications

The InMoov hand is used in:
- Robotics education  
- Humanoid research  
- Prosthetic experiments  
- Animatronics  
- DIY and maker projects  

Its open-source nature allows users to modify, redesign, and improve the system freely.

---

## 7. Advantages

- Fully open-source  
- Affordable & 3D-printable  
- Highly customizable  
- Realistic tendon-based motion  
- Large community support  

---

## 8. Limitations

- Requires precise 3D printing  
- Tendons can wear over time  
- Servos generate heat and require sufficient power  
- Assembly is complex for beginners  

---

## 9. Conclusion

The InMoov humanoid hand and forearm represents one of the best open-source robotic hand systems available today.  
Its realistic motion, modular design, and accessible components make it a valuable tool for learning and experimenting with robotics, mechanical engineering, and human-like motion systems.
